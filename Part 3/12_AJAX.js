/*
    AJAX : BASIC THEORY
        > Asynchronous Javascript And XML

        > is a set of 'web development technique' using many web technologies on the 'client-side' to create asynchronous web application

        > with Ajax, web applications can send and retrieve data from a server asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behaviour of the existing page

        > we don't use data in XML format anymore, we use JSON now

        > we have 3 most common ways to create and send request to server
        1.) xmlHTTPRequest (old way of doing)
        2.) fetch API (new way to doing)
        3.) axios (this is the third party)
